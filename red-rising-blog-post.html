                    Red Rising is about Darrow, a boy who is part of the lowest class of 
                    society, the reds. He works constantly, believing that he's making 
                    Mars habitable. Soon, Darrow discovers that humanity reached the 
                    surface generations ago, and they left the reds as slaves. Longing 
                    for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love he risks everything 
                    to infiltrate the Gold's society.

                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p class="text-preview">
                    Red Rising is one of the best science fiction books there are. Often compared
                    to the Hunger Games, it is a wonderfully crafted novel, set in a dystopian future.
                    Red Rising is perfect for all ages, and while it is about a 16 year old boy, it
                    does not follow any of the normal young adult conventions. The characters are all unique
                    and beautifully written. There is never a dull moment, and readers can expect to be 
                    completely unable to put the book down.

                            Suhana currently attends Broadview Public School. Her favourite hobbys
                            include reading, coding and baking. She loves to build just about anything, whether
                            it's a website, or some overly complex dessert. Suhana is interested in math, coding 
                            and robotics and hopes to work in a field related to these topics.
