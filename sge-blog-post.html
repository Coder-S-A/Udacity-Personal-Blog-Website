                    The School for Good and Evil is a 5 book long series which was 
                    completed in 2020. The story is about to girls named Sophie 
                    and Agatha, who are kidnapped to go to the School for Good 
                    and Evil. Sophie, with her undeniable beauty seems perfect for 
                    the School for Good, while Agatha with her with goth-like attitude, 
                    seems a natural fit for the School for Evil. However, when the two 
                    girls are swept off to the school, their fates are reversed, with Agatha 
                    in the School for Good and Sophie in the School for Evil.

                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p class="text-preview">
                    The School for Good and Evil is a wonderfully written middle-grade novel, 
                    filled with adventure and unpredictability. It takes all of the fairytale stereotypes and 
                    throws them in the garbage. The School for Good and Evil was real, beautiful 
                    and enchanting, and each character was unique and built amazingly. I would 
                    recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique spin on classic fairytales 
                    and how they're viewed.

                            Suhana currently attends Broadview Public School. Her favourite hobbys
                            include reading, coding and baking. She loves to build just about anything, whether
                            it's a website, or some overly complex dessert. Suhana is interested in math, coding 
                            and robotics and hopes to work in a field related to these topics.
