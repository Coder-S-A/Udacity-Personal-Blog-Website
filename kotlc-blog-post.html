                    Blurry, fractured memories swam through Sophie’s mind, but she couldn’t piece them 
                    together. She tried opening her eyes and found only darkness. Something rough pressed 
                    against her wrists and ankles, refusing to let her move.

                    <br>
                    A wave of cold rushed through her as the horrifying realization dawned.

                    She was a hostage.

                            include reading, coding and baking. She loves to build just about anything, whether
                            it's a website, or some overly complex dessert. Suhana is interested in math, coding 
                            and robotics and hopes to work in a field related to these topics.
